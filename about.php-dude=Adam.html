			<p><strong>The Envelope Collective</strong> was an ongoing collaborative experiment in art that used the transportation of mail as a medium. The website serves as an online gallery for those pieces that we received. It was started by two fellows named Garrett & Adam while they attended Oberlin College many years ago. After graduation, real life responsibilities took over and the project was ended.</p>
			<p>What remains in the gallery is an archive of those envelopes received through the two-year run of the project.</p>

			<div style="width: 640px; margin: 3px 0 0 20px"> 
			Garrett was born and raised on a rural farm in Maryland. He enjoys running, good wine, bad beer, dried mango, biking, hopscotch, movies, and talking about himself in the third person. He graduated from Oberlin College in 2006 with double majors in Studio Art and Being Awesome. He now lives in the Washington DC area and supports his renegade, bad-boy lifestyle as a web designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070202014924/http:/envelopecollective.com/about.php?dude=Garrett" class="Garrett">MORE INFO...</a>

			<div style="width: 640px; margin: 3px 0 0 20px"> 
			Adam set out to be a pre-med student at Oberlin College in scenic Oberlin, OH. Upon realizing, however, that he was horrible at the game "Operation", he pursued an art major instead. Using expert advice from his good friend Garrett, Adam learned how to claim that anything he does is art and has stuck with it ever since. He also graduated with a degree in Studio Art, which is what all the cool kids are doing these days. He's in Pasadena working for an architecture firm, designing amusement park rides.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070202014924/http:/envelopecollective.com/about.php?dude=Adam" class="Adam">MORE INFO...</a>
